# Motivate Bot

Motivate Bot is an application that sends motivational and/or wholesome text messages to its subscribers at regular intervals.

This application works with the Twilio API to send a text message to its subscribed users at regular user-defined intervals. 

This was initially meant to be a Facebook messenger bot but Facebook has not yet approved my application request. I decided to switch over to Twilio because it was faster.
